- Get check mate actually working:
  - At the moment, the king apparently has valid moves, but all of those moves would put it in check, so the game doesn't recognise that it's over.
  - To identify checkmate, we need to check every possible move on the board to see if anything can get the king out of check.
  - We also need to check if any possible moves exist that won't lead to check

- Try to DRY up the logic for adding valid moves
- Bug where castling action was triggered

- Imports cleanup (absolute imports, ordering)
- ESLint rules

- Create database
- Setup backend:
  - OAuth
  - Websockets
- Setup home page to create a game with invite link
- Statuses for when the game hasn't started yet
