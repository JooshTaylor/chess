- Check
- Check mate
- Preventing pieces from entering "check"

If I'm about to move a piece into "Check", prevent it:
- Select a move
- Put the board in that state in memory
- For every piece of the other colour, check if one of their valid moves targets the square that the king is on (vulnerabilities)

If I'm currently in check and try to make a move that won't get me out of check, prevent it
- Game must know that my colour is in check (in reducer state)
- Each move validator should check if the board state will still leave my piece vulnerable

If I'm in checkmate, game over
