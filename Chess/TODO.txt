Given the current state of the board, we need to know every possible move for every single piece.
To know every possible move for a piece, we need to simulate that move, then calculate every possible move for every piece in that position, to make

We are in check mate if we are in check and there are zero valid moves. This should be easier to calculate now that our valid moves lookup is accurate
